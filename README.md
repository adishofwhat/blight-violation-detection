# blight-violation-detection
We try understanding when and why a resident might fail to comply with a blight ticket. And with the help of predictive modeling we predict whether a given blight ticket will be paid on time.

Blight violations are issued by the city to individuals who allow their properties to remain in a deteriorated condition. Every year, the city of Detroit issues millions of dollars in fines to residents and every year, many of these fines remain unpaid. Enforcing unpaid blight fines is a costly and tedious process, so the city wants to know: how can we increase blight ticket compliance?

The predictions will be given as the probability that the corresponding blight ticket will be paid on time.
The evaluation metric for this assignment is the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC). And after further checking I obtained a 0.7577 AUROC score of the model.
